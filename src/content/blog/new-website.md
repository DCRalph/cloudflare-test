# OUTDATED
I overhauled this recently again with Next 15 and React 19

---

Recently decided to redesign and revamp my site. I had a few main goals:

- Easier content management for blog posts
- Simplified, minimal design
- Better performance

## Cool Features

It is now posable to use the `code` tag to highlight code blocks. For example:

```js
const a = 2;
let b = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  b = b + a;
  console.log(a * i);
}
```

```js
const [age, setAge] = useState(50); // Colors too
const [name, setName] = useState("Taylor");

const x =
  "long string to demonstrate scrollable code block. long string to demonstrate scrollable code block.";
```

## What I used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for blog posts
- [Content Layer](https://contentlayer.dev/) for content management
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations
- And custom components for everything else

## What I learned

- How to use MDX
- A more in-depth understanding of Next.js
- A more in-depth understanding of Tailwind CSS
- How to use Framer Motion

## What I want to do next

- Continue to build out my portfolio on here
