			<h1>Hey, I'm William.</h1>
			<p>
				I'm a Software Engineer from Wellington, New Zealand, currently serving as Head of Technology Operations at <a href="https://bactosure.com/">Bactosure</a>, where I build innovative software for rapid water bacteria testing.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've spent the last 10 years learning and tinkering with different technologies, which has led me to where I am today—studying a Software Engineering degree at Yoobee College while working full-time in the tech industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life through software excites me. Whether it's creating algorithms, designing user-friendly interfaces, or exploring the backend of systems, I'm passionate about building solutions that make a difference.
			</p>
			<h2>What I Work With</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>For Fun:</strong> React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Node.js, Linux, Docker, Git, C++, Python, Proxmox, Swift
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>At Work:</strong> C++, Python, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Arduino, AWS, Firebase, Git, TensorFlow, ERPNext, Linux, Networking, Security, DevOps, Cloud, AI, Machine Learning
			</p>
			<h2>My Journey</h2>
			<p>

I've been with the company since August 2023, progressing from Software Engineer to Technology Manager, and now to my current role.
