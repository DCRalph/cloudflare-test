	<p>
		Hey! I'm William, a Software Engineer from Wellington, New Zealand. I've spent the last 10 years 
		learning and tinkering with different technologies, which has shaped my journey into software engineering. 
		Solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life through software excites me—whether it's creating 
		algorithms, designing user-friendly interfaces, or exploring the backend of systems.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm currently studying a Software Engineering degree at Yoobee College while working full-time as the 
		Head of Technology Operations at <a href="https://bactosure.com/">Bactosure</a>, where I build software 
		for rapid water bacteria testing. My work combines embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, and machine 
		learning to create innovative solutions that make a real-world impact.
	</p>

	<h2>My Journey</h2>

	<p>
		I joined Bactosure in August 2023 as a Software Engineer, developing device software and cloud-based 
		systems for cost-effective rapid bacteria detection in water. The role challenged me to work across 
		the full stack—from low-level C++ on embedded devices to cloud infrastructure on AWS and Firebase.
	</p>

	<p>
		In November 2023, I progressed to Technology Manager, taking on additional responsibilities for 
		networking infrastructure and security protocols. This role expanded my expertise into DevOps, 
		network architecture, and security best practices.
	</p>

	<p>
		In January 2026, I transitioned into my current role as Head of Technology Operations. Now I'm 
		responsible for managing all technical operations, optimizing network reliability, strengthening 
		security protocols, and ensuring seamless technical support to enhance product performance and 
		support commercial operations.
	</p>

	<h2>Technologies I Use</h2>

	<p>
		<strong>For Fun:</strong> I love experimenting with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Node.js, 
		Linux, Docker, Git, C++, Python, Proxmox, and Swift. I'm always exploring new frameworks and tools 
		to expand my skillset.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>At Work:</strong> My day-to-day involves C++, Python, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Arduino, AWS, 
		Firebase, Git, TensorFlow, ERPNext, Linux, Networking, Security, DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, 
		AI, and Machine Learning. I work across the entire technology stack to deliver reliable, scalable 
		solutions.
	</p>

	<h2>What Drives Me</h2>

	<p>
		I'm passionate about building technology that solves real problems. At Bactosure, I get to work on 
		systems that help ensure water safety—a critical issue that affects communities worldwide. The 
		combination of hardware, software, cloud services, and AI/ML makes every day a new challenge and 
		learning opportunity.
	</p>

	<p>
		Beyond work, I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies. Whether it's setting up a 
		home lab with Proxmox, building web apps with Next.js, or diving into machine learning with 
		TensorFlow, I believe in hands-on learning and continuous improvement.
